    /* 4. Fibonacci

    For a fibonacci sequence starting at 0 and 1 add up all the values below 1,000,000.
    
    A Fibonacci sequence is an infinite series of numbers that is created by adding the 
    last two numbers in the series. A series would start with the numbers 0 and 1 in 
    place, followed by 1 (0+1), 2 (1+1), 3 (1+2), 5 (3+2), etc.
